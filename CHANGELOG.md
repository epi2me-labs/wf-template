and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- Reordered README sections so that pipeline overview is before input parameters.
- "FAQ's" section corrected to "FAQs".

## [v5.6.2]
### Added
- IGV configuration now allows per-track customisation options such as display mode, show alignments and color by.
- IGV additional option `--keep-track-order` to output the tracks in the order specified in the fofn file. Default behaviour is to sort lexicographically.
### Fixed
- Updated common image to `sha72f3517dd994984e0e2da0b97cb3f23f8540be4b` to:
    - Update to ezcharts 0.14.1, fixing:
        - Unbalanced columns in LeadSummary component
        - Report appearance when Noto Sans is unavailable

## [v5.6.1]
This release fixes a dependency problem in our testing system and makes no changes to our workflow template standard.
### Fixed
- FailedToLoadPlugin when running flake8 via pre-commit. Resolved by avoiding snowballstemmer's recent major release by pinning it in our precommit config.

## [v5.6.0]
### Fixed
- Dacite (which allows reading a previously made results model into another process) error when barcode field is null: `dacite.exceptions.WrongTypeError: wrong value type for field "samples.barcode" - should be "str" instead of value "None" of type "NoneType"`
- Updated ezcharts to 0.14.0, fixing:
    - Sequence summary read length N50 incorrectly displayed minimum read length, it now correctly shows the N50.
    - Sequence summary component alignment and coverage plots failed to plot under some conditions.
### Changed
- Updated common image to `sha1c69fd30053aad5d516e9567b3944384325a0fee` to:
    - Add dacite to allow workflows to more easily manipulate data from schemas for reporting.
    - Remove excessive debug logging from fastcat which can occlude errors found in FASTQ files during ingress.
    - Update ezcharts to 0.14.0 which now allows:
        - LeadSummary and QC tables
        - Page number footer
- Update epi2melabs version in pre-commit so README links to the Docker "Get started" guide instead of Docker Desktop docs in preamble.
- Updated banner text to say "EPI2ME" instead of "EPI2ME Labs" to match current branding. This has no effect on the workflow other than the banner text in Nextflow standard output.
### Added
- Client fields (key value pairs used for display in the reports) are now included in the workflow results model.
- Common WorkflowBaseModel provides get_reportable_value method to prettify any model field with appropriate decimal places and units for reporting purposes.
- Common SampleModel provides get_reportable_qc_status method to homogenise the QC criteria display on ONT reports.
- Common WorkflowResult provides load_versions and load_params methods to load versions and params files into the model.
- Common WorkflowBaseModel provides get method that returns a pretty tuple with title and value (or just value) with units for a field in the model.


## [v5.5.0]
### Changed
- Removed Pydantic dependency and autogenerated models using `results_schema.yml` and created a new model namespace using dataclasses.

## [v5.4.0]
### Added
- MinKNOW experiment directories may now be ingressed. Users must provide a sample sheet and/or a sample name to explicitly indicate which samples to analyse.
- Sample sheet input cases may now ingress sample folders named after the alias in the sample sheet, and not just the barcodes.
### Fixed
- Added `.DS_store` to `.gitignore` to prevent EPI2ME Desktop users on MacOS dirtying workflow git directories.
- Input file paths can contain single quotes.
- Rescoped ingress global state to prevent an edge case where metadata could be mixed when resuming a multi-ingress workflow.
### Changed
