### Input Options

| Nextflow parameter name  | Type | Description | Help | Default |
|--------------------------|------|-------------|------|---------|
| fastq | string | FASTQ files to use in the analysis. | This accepts one of three cases: (i) the path to a single FASTQ file; (ii) the path to a top-level directory containing FASTQ files; (iii) the path to a directory containing one level of sub-directories which in turn contain FASTQ files. In the first and second case, a sample name can be supplied with `--sample`. In the last case, the data is assumed to be multiplexed with the names of the sub-directories as barcodes. In this case, a sample sheet can be provided with `--sample_sheet`. |  |
| bam | string | BAM or unaligned BAM (uBAM) files to use in the analysis. | This accepts one of three cases: (i) the path to a single BAM file; (ii) the path to a top-level directory containing BAM files; (iii) the path to a directory containing one level of sub-directories which in turn contain BAM files. In the first and second case, a sample name can be supplied with `--sample`. In the last case, the data is assumed to be multiplexed with the names of the sub-directories as barcodes. In this case, a sample sheet can be provided with `--sample_sheet`. |  |
| analyse_unclassified | boolean | Analyse unclassified reads from input directory. By default the workflow will not process reads in the unclassified directory. | If selected and if the input is a multiplex directory the workflow will also process the unclassified directory. | False |
| watch_path | boolean | Enable to continuously watch the input directory for new input files. | This option enables the use of Nextflow’s directory watching feature to constantly monitor input directories for new files. | False |
| fastq_chunk | integer | Sets the maximum number of reads per chunk returned from the data ingress layer. | Default is to not chunk data and return a single FASTQ file. |  |


### Sample Options

| Nextflow parameter name  | Type | Description | Help | Default |
|--------------------------|------|-------------|------|---------|
| sample_sheet | string | A CSV file used to map barcodes to sample aliases. The sample sheet can be provided when the input data is a directory containing sub-directories with FASTQ files. | The sample sheet is a CSV file with, minimally, columns named `barcode` and `alias`. Extra columns are allowed. A `type` column is required for certain workflows and should have the following values; `test_sample`, `positive_control`, `negative_control`, `no_template_control`. An optional `analysis_group` column is used by some workflows to combine the results of multiple samples. If the `analysis_group` column is present, it needs to contain a value for each sample. |  |
| sample | string | A single sample name for non-multiplexed data. Permissible if passing a single .fastq(.gz) file or directory of .fastq(.gz) files. |  |  |


### Output Options

| out_dir | string | Directory for output of all workflow results. |  | output |
